# Failure of "SDK Deployment" Job

```bash
$ aws s3 cp $CI_PROJECT_DIR/tf_ssh_priv_key.pem s3://${BUCKET}/$VAR_environment}/standalone-sdk-vm/ --sse
user-provided path /builds/infrastructure/mmd-46/tf_ssh_priv_key.pem does not exist.
```

This issue is encountered when the SSH Key for the SDK VM is missing from the GitLab project folder for the deployment.
