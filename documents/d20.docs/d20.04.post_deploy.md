# INSTALL POST DEPLOYMENT ERRORS

Errors encountered when running “Install Post-Deployment” (under Deploy loop):

* This is the mojaloop simulators - a recent addition: consider whether they required.
* Re-run the deployment job (simply click on the retry button). This will currently fix a recurring issue with missing entities.
